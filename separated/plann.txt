levels
  - project ideas
    - 3-4 projects because be reasonable
      tictactoe - instantiate different board sizes
      summary details - add and remove "profile" instances
      searchable dictionary - instantiate with word list, words have their own delete button
    - must be instanceable
    - will be same projects through all 3 levels
    - besides creation, 3 levels must be the same
    - introduce the board/square concept
    a tictactoe board that takes the height and width as data
    de-async the projects from async-programming
    multiply the projects from literals
  object literals
    all use binding handlers
  object.create
    introduce the idea of a "container" class that manages instances
  classes
